# Novel Lesbian Category Finder
 Me and my friends talk a lot about queer taxonomies ("Are you a Lana gay? Or a Mitski gay?""What's the difference between a sword-lesbian and a motorcycle-lesbian?") and we noticed how many of the categories we come up with as queer people take the form word-sexuality (art-gay, muscle-queen, chaos-bisexual etc.). I thought this was interesting and I wanted to do data science about it. 
 
I've used [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) to write a program that collects 1000 new tweets containing the word "lesbian" every hour. When I have enough sapphic tweets I'll start doing some exploratory data analysis.
